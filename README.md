# Domain-Generation-Algorism
### Classification of Domain Generation Algorithm based Malware using Ensemble and Deep Hybrid Learning. 
This work focus was on designing efficient models for the detection and 
classification of DGA-based malware based on the reliability and accuracy of predictions in both 
binary and multiclass classification by using ensemble and deep hybrid learning (ML+DL) 
algorithms.
